Empowering Women in the Renewable Energy Sector
</span>

GEEST (Geospatial Assessment of Women Employment and Business Opportunities in the Renewable Energy Sector) is an innovative, open-source tool designed to support women's economic empowerment in Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

By leveraging advanced geospatial mapping and a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE)framework, GEEST identifies regions with the greatest potential for women's employment and business opportunities in renewable energy.
Our tool helps bridge the gender gap in the energy sector by guiding new projects toward creating inclusive, enabling environments for women.
